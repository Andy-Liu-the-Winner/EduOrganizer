Project Name: EduOrganizer
Description: EduOrganizer is an app to track of schedule and assignments(tasks). For the schedule part,
we can add different courses in weekdays with specific locations and time. We can click Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday... to check the courses afterwards. For our assignment section, it is like a to-do list. We can
manually select three colors first: Carnegie Mellon Red, Dartmouth Green, and Yale Blue. Then, we click 
the input text section. Then, it pops out another window to add my to-do tasks with due dates. Once we add
them, they are on the screen. Once we have done the task, we can click the rectangle at the left of the task
to remove the task or we can dis-remove it if we accidentally press. On the screen, we have 6 tasks. If we 
click the right or up button, the page would go up, vice versa with the left and down button with 6 tasks 
in each page. For example: if we have ['a','b','c','d','e','f','g'],first six elements would be presented 
here as ['a','b','c','d','e','f']. If we press page up, the presented task would be ['g','a','b','c','d','e'] 
(six elements). In the process, we can check the schedule page, or go back to assignment page.
